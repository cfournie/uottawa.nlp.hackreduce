uOttawa NLP HackReduce Project
==============================

We analyzed the sentiment of Amazon product reviews. We trends between the
percentage of particular sentiment words and a review's rating of a product.
The Java code is very rough, but the data found in the /runs/ folders may
be of interest, and scripts to convert it into Weka's ARFF format are
provided.

Directories
-----------

- /data/ - Additional datasets or data files that we will be using
- /libs/ - Location to store libraries used
- /src/ - Eclipse projects
- /runs/ - Resulting output from 3 separate development milestones (the last being the most significant).
